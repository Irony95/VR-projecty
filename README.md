# VR-projecty

This repo contains the code for the an arduino VR controller, and the unity project that works with the controller.
The code is like super badly written, so feel free to change, update and copy if u want to lol.

The arduino uses a magnetometer, gyroscope, acelerometer for the upper arm rotation measurement, a potentiometer for the forearm rotation measurement, and some buttons for the inputs. The data are all sent to the unity code.

The arduino sends a string of information to the bluetooth in an android phone, which reads it and updates the values blah blah.
